        <h1>Sir Isaac Newton</h1>
        <h2>
          A towering figure in the history of science, revolutionized our
          understanding of the physical world with his laws of motion, theory of
          universal gravitation, and pioneering work in calculus and optics.

        <h2>Major Event in Sir Isaac Newton Life's</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Formulation of Three Laws of Motion (circa 1666-1667): </strong>Newton formulated his laws of motion,
            including the law of inertia,
            acceleration, and action-reaction principle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Development of Law of Universal Gravitation (circa 1665-1666): </strong>Newton developed the law of
            universal gravitation, which he
            published in his work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"
            in 1687.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invention of Calculus (late 1660s to early 1670s): </strong>Newton independently developed calculus
            during this period,
            although its publication was delayed due to a dispute with Gottfried
            Wilhelm Leibniz over priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Groundbreaking Experiments in Optics (1660s): </strong>Newton conducted experiments on optics, such as
            his famous prism
            experiments that demonstrated the composite nature of light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proposal of Particle Theory of Light (late 17th century): </strong>Newton proposed the particle theory
            of light, challenging the
            prevailing view of light as waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contributions to Understanding of Cooling (early 18th century): </strong>Newton made contributions to
            the understanding of cooling,
            including the formulation of Newton's law of cooling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investigation of Thin-Film Interference (circa 1665): </strong>Newton investigated thin-film
            interference, which led to his
            discovery of Newton's rings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Development of Mathematical Methods (late 17th century): </strong>Newton developed mathematical
            methods for solving problems in
            dynamics, celestial mechanics, and other fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Publication of "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"
              (1687):
            </strong>
            Newton's masterpiece, where he presented his laws of motion and law
            of universal gravitation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Election as President of the Royal Society (1703): </strong>Newton was elected President of the Royal
            Society, a position he
            held until his death, overseeing advancements in scientific research
            and collaboration.
